## Overview

The `Agentic Web Protocol`, or `AWP`, *allows **AI agents** to reliably **understand and interact with the web***.

It is composed of two protocols, for web pages and APIs, allowing them to be usable by AI agents.

A standard [Universal Tool](https://github.com/spacehendrix/universal-intelligence) is also provided, for AI agents to be able to instantly leverage `AWP` compliant pages and APIs.

## Protocol Specifications

### Web pages

#### Introduction

> ##### The Challenge of Web Interactivity for AI Agents
>
> Without information about what a web page is for, how it is structured, what features it provides, and how to interact with it, an AI agent has to figure out everything on its own.
>
> This is commonly done through scrappers and/or vision models aimed at guessing what the agent sees.
>
> Websites being diverse, complex, dynamic, Javascript-heavy and often moslty made of generic `<div>`s, this exercise commonly leads to unreliable parsing and broken/unintended interactions.
>
> Intelligent agents need richer semantic hints to parse and interact with these pages reliably.

The premise of `AWP` is simple: **include standard information in the HTML page** itself, for **any agent to be able to reliably understand and interact** with it.

For an agent to so, the following information needs to be attached to *meaninful* and/or *interactive* HTML tags:

1. A `description`, for it to know what it is.
2. A list of possible `interactions`, for it to know what to do.
3. A list of `prerequisites`, for it to know what to do prior to interacting.
4. A list of subsequent `features`, for it to know what those interactions lead to.

Additional optional information such as `states`, or established *accessibility* parameters (eg. `role`, `aria-*`) may also be used to complement the agent's understanding of the page.

#### Contract

Let's start with a simple example. Your agent just found this website by crawling the web:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form>
      This site uses cookies
      <button>Configure</button>
    </form>
    <form>
      <h1> Website name </h1>
      <label> What's next? </label>
      <input
        type="text"
        name="destination"
        required
        minlength="3"
        maxlength="30"/>
      <div>
        <button disabled> -> </button>
        <button> Back </button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

It now needs to *understand what it is for*, to know if it can be used to answer your query, and if so, *how to interact* with it?

For all reasons described above, this often becomes a difficult and error-prone task —leading to unintended behaviors and impairing the agent's ability to act reliably on our behalf.

With `AWP`, this information is now declared in the HTML itself, through standard ***optional*** `ai-*` attributes.

```html
<html ai-description="Travel site to book flights and trains">
  <body>
    <form>
      This site uses cookies
      <button>Configure</button>
    </form>
    <form ai-description="Form to book a flight">
      <h1>
        Website name
      </h1>
      <label>
        What's next?
      </label>
      <input
        ai-ref="<input-ai-ref>"
        ai-description="Form input where to enter the destination"
        ai-interactions="input: enables the form confirmation button, given certain constraints;"
        type="text"
        name="destination"
        required
        minlength="3"
        maxlength="30"/>
      <div>
        <button
          ai-description="Confirmation button to proceed with booking a flight"
          ai-interactions="click: proceed; hover: diplay additonal information about possible flights;"
          ai-prerequisite-click="<input-ai-ref>: input the destination;"
          ai-next-click="list of available flights; book a flight; login;"
          disabled>
          ->
        </button>
        <button
          ai-description="Cancel button to get back to the home page"
          ai-interactions="click: dismiss form and return to home page;"
          ai-next-click="access forms to book trains; access forms to book flights;">
          Back
        </button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

> The web app can now be reliably **understood and used by *any* AI agents** 🙌

### APIs

#### Introduction

> ##### The Challenge of API Interactivity for AI Agents
>
> Without information about what an API is for, how it is structured, what features it provides, and how to interact with it, an AI agent has to figure out everything on its own. 
>
> This is commonly passed manually as context, fetched via web crawlers attempting to find documentation online, or by spinning up additional middleware servers (eg. [mcp](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)) to allow them to be discoverable.

The premise of `AWP` is simple: **include standard information in the API** itself, for **any agent to be able to reliably understand and interact** with it, without requiring additional middleware servers to do so.

For an agent to know how to use any API, the following information needs to be discoverable:

1. A list of all each available `endpoints` on that API, to know what they are
2. A `description` for each endpoint, to know what they are for
3. `meta` information for each endpoint, to know how to access them
4. An `input` documentation for each endpoint, to know what to provide
5. An `output` documentation for each endpoint, to know what to expect

#### Contract

With `AWP`, the API documentation is made accessible on the API itself, with a standard `/ai-handshake` endpoint.

This allows AI agents to query `/ai-handshake`, get a complete description of the API, and know how to further interact with it.

For simplicity, and since it is a well established standard on the web, the `AWP` expects a [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) compliant documentation to be returned by that endpoint.

Here is a simple example:
[https://editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io)

##### Standard Endpoint

| Path | Description | Type | Method | Input | Output | Requirement |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| `/ai-handshake` | Standard endpoint returning a [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) compliant documentation of the API which hosts the endpoint, excluding `/ai-handshake`, JSON or YAML based on headers | REST | GET | Headers:<br><br>`"Content-Type": "application/yaml"`(recommended)<br>or<br>`"Content-Type": "application/json"` | [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) compliant documentation, of requested `Content-Type` (eg. YAML, JSON, text) | `required` |

> An **AWP Tool** is also distributed by this library to allow any AI agent to reliably use `AWP` compliant API.

##### Parse API

###### Input

`GET https//example.api.com/ai-handshake`

###### Output

[OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) compliant documentation, YAML (default) or JSON per requested format.

Example available [here](https://editor.swagger.io).

> **Tip**: Tools like [Swagger](https://swagger.io) can automatically generate a [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) compliant documentation for your API which you may serve at `/ai-handshake`. They usually also provide no-code UIs to display and interact wich that documentation on the web (eg. [Swagger UI](https://editor.swagger.io)).

#### Playground

A ready-made playground is available to help familiarize yourself with the AWP protocols and tools.
